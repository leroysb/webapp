                    <p>As a barman turned ambassador, Grant’s Whisky Global Brand Ambassador, Daniel Dyer is just beginning to experience the goodies accompanied with this role especially now that Grant’s Whisky has introduced a new bottle, the Triple Wood.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p><span class="padded-dropcap">E</span>leven months have passed since the title of Grant’s Brand Ambassador (B.A.) was bestowed to him, out of 5000 applicants who submitted their entry globally, “Do you know what’s really funny,” says Daniel Dyer, “That day I decided to apply for the role as Global B.A. of Grant’s Whisky, I was going through my daily routine behind the bar counter questioning my life decisions and whether I wanted to do this for the rest of my life.” As he was in deep thought, he took out his phone and logged into Facebook. “It was like a sign, I was scrolling and there it was on my feed, ‘Do you want to travel the world and sell whisky’ “ We now know how that story ended.</p>
                    <p>Acquiring the role of brand ambassador is not as easy as it looks, just like any other line of work, one needs to be passionate. Passionate about the whisky making craft and everything in between, from the maturation process to the bottling. It requires discipline and some form of wit, especially when finding new ways to attract whisky lovers and make the spirit more accessible to a wider audience. Danny’s life now involves travelling around the world promoting whiskies. “My role is pretty weird but the aim is always to increase awareness of our brands and drive sales,” comments Daniel. ”Becoming a Global Ambassador has always been a dream goal for me and achieving it is odd because I now need to have a new goal as B.A. which includes getting people to talk and get hyped about Grant’s. The liquid is still as legendary, the bottle is great, so let’s have fun.”</p>
                    <p>Growing up in Aberlour on the North East of Scotland, Daniel Dyer’s previous life prepared him for this exceptional role. He’s worked at a number of distilleries and exclusive clubs across Scotland where he gathered his knowledge of whisky over the years as a bartender. From working at The Mash Tun Whisky Bar, where he led tastings and went as far as writing a whisky tasting book touching base over one hundred different whiskies not leaving behind the art of whisky making. His passion for the industry has also seen him working at the Scotch malt whisky society as an ambassador.</p>
                    <p>Over the short duration of time that Daniel Dyer has been Global Brand Ambassador of Grant’s Whisky, he’s travelled to nine countries around the world selling the refreshed brand, with every visit different from the last. It also happens to be his first visit to Africa, having made his first stop in Tanzania. Daniel was lucky enough to drive his way through Arusha to Nairobi where he got to interact with locals and explore nature – a view that he only witnessed in Nat Geo – as he drove through the Serengeti. He even got to taste a small bit of Nairobi’s nightlife scene when visiting J’s Fresh Bar and Kitchen.</p>
                    <p>But why now? For as long as we can all remember, Grant’s Whisky has always been that iconic bottle with the triangular shaped double rock glass, which we all have stashed somewhere in our cabinets. Why the new facelift? “Times have changed and we need to move with it and we now want everyone to feel part of Grant’s Whisky history,” he comments. For the few who were lucky enough to attend one of the many activations and training sessions that Daniel has conducted since the launch of the new bottle in Nairobi, they can attest to his comments. “Grant’s whisky is the third top scotch whisky in the world and we need to shout about it. Us doing this, now, is to let everyone know that we are proud of our achievement. The team have done a fantastic job and it is a lot of hard work and effort from the Grants Family, everyone at the distilleries to the marketing team and all the distributors including you the consumer, it’s a group effort. We want everyone to be part of Grant’s history”</p>
                    <p>Not only does the new Grant’s Whisky come with a new refreshed bottle, but the brand name has also changed to Grant’s Triple Wood, derived from the three different casks used to mature the whisky. The Virgin Oak cask that gives it that spicy, ginger flavour, the second is the American Oak to infuse a subtle vanilla smoothness and lastly, Refill Bourbon for that sweetness.</p>
                    <p>If you take a closer look at the bottle, you’ll notice a phrase repeated on the bottle, ‘Stand Fast’. “Stand Fast is huge to us and it’s actually the first time it’s been on the bottle for over 25 years.” says Daniel as he explains the story behind the phrase, “It is our clan motto that basically means to hold strong to your views. The story goes that there was a King running away from invaders with his men when he stopped at the hilltop of a small village called Vigil, very close to Dufftown where Grant’s distilleries were located. And that’s where he made his stance. He saw a small tree which he ripped out and said to his men – This is where we hold strong, this is where we fight them. This is where we stand fast, this is where we stand together – They held true to their views, stood together and fought.” So the next time you get yourself a Grant’s Triple Wood remember, you are drinking a great whisky, a whisky with history and you are now part of that history.</p>
                    <p>As we approach the December holidays and you are looking for a gift to give a friend who happens to be a whisky lover, Daniel Dyer has the perfect recommendation for you, “Get them a gift of being able to play around with Grants, and that’s simple. Start by buying them a bottle of Grant’s Triple Wood and a cocktail kit."</p>

                </div>

                <img src="{% static 'blogapp/media/2_1.jpg' %}" alt="2_1" style="width: 100%;">

                <div style="padding: 4% 0% 4% 0%;">
                    <p><span class="padded-dropcap">T</span>here is something about Brand Ambassadors with their mussed-up hairstyles, classy attire, and mountains of charisma that gets all the ladies buzzed whenever we are having a tasting at the office. This was the case when Martell’s brand ambassador, Ugo Messi, dropped by for a Cognac tasting earlier this month.</p>
                    <p>It is 4pm on the day before we break for Easter when Messi walks in. His arrival does not go unnoticed, as all the women in the office turn their heads, and just like that, we dudes are relegated to the sidelines. No sooner than have office hours officially ended, the ladies rush down the stairs to our backyard garden. By the time the rest of us follow suit, the females have already grabbed their seats with a prime view of the, ahem, show.</p>
                    <p>For those not in the know, the iconic House of Martell was born in a small town in the west of France called Cognac in 1715. Martell is one of the most recognised cognac brands in the world and we are all excited to get a taste, especially for those who have never even had a sip of the stuff.</p>
                    <p>“There are two main ingredients for making Cognac,” says Messi, expertly launching into his tried and tested presentation. “The first ingredient is grapes, the second, love,” he continues while placing three tulip-shaped glasses in front of each of us. “For Cognac, we do not have age statements, we only have quality statements. This is what elevates the spirit from the rest</p>
                    <p>Messi goes on to explain that the quality statements are VS standing for Very Special, VSOP for Very Superior Old Pale and XO. No hugs and kisses will be flying around, not now at least, it is far too early for that. “XO stands for Extra Old”, says Messi finishing off on the basics of his presentation.</p>
                    <p>As we continue to hear about the history of the brand, I ponder that no matter how fat your wallet is or how fancy you carry yourself, you stand no chance against a man with a French accent, especially when such man is of Cameroonian descent.</p>
                    <p>“What is the best and only way to drink Cognac?” the question interrupts my reveries. The answer is not entirely expected: “Your way, you have to enjoy it your way, depending on the mood. Whether you like your drink iced up and on the rocks, as a cocktail or with a mixer”.</p>
                    <p>Starting off the tasting is the Martell VS, which has a fruity aroma from the grapes and is soft in the mouth. This is not the case with the second bottle, the VSOP which has a woody aroma and I find mildly harsh to the throat. The XO instead tastes smooth, its aromas spicy on the nose and intense in the mouth.</p>
                    <p>By the time darkness engulfs us, one more bottle is unveiled. This is the VSSD, a Very Special Single Distillery line which has yet to hit the market. Just by looking at its archshaped bottle, and the jealousy with which Messi cradles it, it becomes obvious that this is the brand’s new golden child. After a short walkthrough on the new bottle’s history and how it is prepared, we all lift our glasses to our nose to capture its scent before taking a sip, or gulps, for those who are already too far gone.</p>
                    <P>The night is still young and the Martell is coursing through our veins whispering to our minds to loosen up. Who are we to say no? Before you know it we have decided the only way forward is a good old karaoke session. Luckily for the women though, Messi packs his bags up and prepares to leave, I’m not sure what impression their vocal cords would have made.</P>

                </div>

                <img src="{% static 'blogapp/media/1_1.jpg' %}" alt="1_1" style="width: 100%;">

                <div style="padding: 4% 0% 4% 0%;">
                    <p><span class="padded-dropcap">I</span>t is 6 AM when we disembark at the Kilifi bus stage and are welcomed by a quenching morning sun. Unlike Nairobi, where the weather had been fresh and breezy, here the air is heavy and humid. We hail a tuk-tuk and make our way to Distant Relatives Eco-Lodge where we arrive in good time to catch a morning espresso with a BLT sandwich breakfast.</p>
                    <p>I had been invited to Kilifi alongside my fellow DJ Coco Em, both of us members of the Bad Mambo DJ collective, to play at a silent disco (you know, those ones where everyone wears headphones). When my editor found out where I was headed, she insisted that I get one of the staff at Distant Relatives to divulge the recipe for the legendary Miraa Juice that the lodge knocks-up every year for their New Year’s Eve festival.</p>
                    <p>The debate about the legal status of Miraa (also known as Khat, a flowering plant native to the Horn of Africa which acts as a mild stimulant and has been part of the social fabric of certain local communities for many centuries) in Kenya has ebbed and flowed over the years. Currently, it is legal here but not in Tanzania or Uganda and in over 15 countries around Europe. While in Kenya there is a certain amount of stigma attached to the chewing of miraa, there is an increasing movement geared towards creating juices out of it that gives people an energy boost when out dancing.</p>
                    <p>Just as I am preparing to retire to bed and rest a couple of hours after the long overnight trip, one of the Distant Relatives guys turns up accompanied by a short stocky man in a black t-shirt. Between them, I see they are carrying a blender and all the essentials needed for the upcoming miraa juice presentation. I resign myself to the fact that I probably won’t get any sleep that day, don my reporter’s cap and get my notepad out.</p>
                    <p>Maximus Kitisao, known by everyone simply as “Max”, is the man behind the legendary miraa shot sensation. He tells me he has been the guy behind the counter, churning out miraa juice since the team first came up with the idea at the first Distant Relatives NYE in 2015.</p>
                    <p>“Miraa shots were not originally birthed in Kenya,” as Max talks, he begins to empty bags of leafy green and reddish stalks onto the counter and chops the leaves into small bits “It is ironic since miraa is a native plant originating from the Horn of Africa and the Arabian peninsula”. Max launches into a complicated story about how he heard about the idea of juicing miraa from a visiting Yemeni who had learned it from an Arab Israeli who had moved to Yemen from Tel Aviv. By this time everything is finely cut so he pours it into the blender and adds the lime juice. As the blender springs into action, a bittersweet aroma hits my nostrils.</p>
                    <p>Max transfers the mixture from the blender to a bowl covered with a cloth. “The reason of doing this is to sieve out the small bits of the unblended Khat so we can get the fine juice’” Turns out the small chunks of unblended khat can later be dried and packed into sachets which can be used to make miraa tea. He finishes everything off by adding berry juice to the mixture. Word gets out that the juice is ready and guests from the lodge begin to crowd around us, eager to have a taste.</p>
                    <p>He pours the green mixture into a line of shot glasses “Here is to miraa” he raises his glass and, as tradition prescribes, he takes the first sip. Once he has certified it, the rest of the group follows suit. After the initial shock at the dryness of the lemon and chlorophyll, I am left with a surprisingly soothing and distinct taste in the mouth.</p>
                    <p>That night I get on the decks and play to a silent dancefloor. I am happy and elated but can’t tell if this is down to the shots or the sea breeze. Let’s see what it does to the DJ set I will be playing at the festival for this coming New Year.</p>
